Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢
This project focuses on predicting passenger survival during the Titanic disaster using machine learning. The analysis explores the factors that influenced survival rates and builds a classification model to make predictions.

📌 Project Overview
The goal of this notebook is to perform a complete data science workflow on the Titanic dataset, starting from exploratory data analysis to evaluating the final model's performance.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (Main language)

Pandas & NumPy (Data cleaning and manipulation)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualizing trends and patterns)

Scikit-Learn (Building and evaluating the Logistic Regression model)

📊 Project Steps
Data Loading & Cleaning: Handling missing values in the dataset and preparing it for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Discovering relationships between passenger features (like Class, Age, and Sex) and their survival chances.

Feature Engineering: Encoding categorical data and selecting the most relevant features for the model.

Model Training: Training a Logistic Regression classifier on the processed data.

Performance Evaluation: Using metrics like Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report to measure how well the model predicts survival.

📈 Key Results
The model uses features such as passenger class, gender, and age to determine the probability of survival. The output provides a clear insight into the "women and children first" protocol and how socio-economic status played a role in survival.
